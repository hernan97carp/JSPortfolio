# Two-Day Testing Challenge

Welcome to the two-day testing challenge! During this period, I will embark on a mission to conduct as many tests as possible, including thorough
testing on the web applications I have developed. The goal is to explore and evaluate all sections of my portfolio to ensure optimal performance and a
seamless user experience.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Complete Coverage:**

    - Tests will be conducted on all sections of the portfolio.
    - Functionality and appearance will be verified on different devices and browsers.

2. **Web Application Testing:**

    - A comprehensive analysis of developed web applications will be carried out, identifying potential improvements and ensuring system stability.

3. **Development Efficiency:**

    - Due to time constraints, the Page Object Model (POM) will not be implemented on this occasion to expedite the process; a quick and efficient
      approach will be maintained.

4. **Code Readability:**

    - Despite not using POM, code clarity and readability will be ensured to facilitate future collaborations and maintenance.

5. **Environment Variables:**
    - They were not used on this occasion for test development. However, it is always important to do so.

## Appreciations:

Thank you for staying until the end! ðŸš€
